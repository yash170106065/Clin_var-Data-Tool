# ClinVar
ClinVar is a public resource containing annotations about human genetic variants. These variants are (usually manually) classified by clinical laboratories on a categorical spectrum ranging from benign, likely benign, uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, and pathogenic. Variants that have conflicting classifications (from laboratory to laboratory) can cause confusion when clinicians or researchers try to interpret whether the variant has an impact on the disease of a given patient.
## Class (Conflicting or Non-Conflicting)
The objective is to predict whether a ClinVar variant will have conflicting classifications. This is presented here as a binary classification problem, where each record in the dataset is a genetic variant.
